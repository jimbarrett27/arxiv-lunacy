# arxiv-lunacy

New pet project, started July 2023

This is my attempt to recreate the golden days of [arxiv sanity](https://arxiv-sanity-lite.com/), to allow me to better keep up to date with preprints and find those relevant to my work.

# Getting started

You can get yourself setup for development of this repo in the way you would expect. Assuming you have conda already setup;

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate arxiv-lunacy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And then follow the instructions for installing pytorch based on your configuration [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
